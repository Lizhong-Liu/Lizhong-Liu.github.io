## **[House-Purchase Restriction Policy in China: Impacts on Household Consumption](https://lizhong-liu.github.io/2019/09/22/HPRP/)**
Liu, L. Ongoing.

<div style="text-align: justify">Housing is one of the most important component to China's economy. However, the soaring housing prices engender concerns related to the stability of China’s financial system and macro fundamentals, as well as to the welfare of individual household. In order to curb the surging housing prices, a series of policies were introduced by the government, targeting at both the demand and the supply side. Amongst of these policy tools, House-Purchase Restriction Policy (HPRP, or ["Xiangou"](http://wiki.china.org.cn/wiki/index.php/Purchase_restriction_order)) is unique. It specifies that people without local [“Hukou”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hukou_system) and paying taxes for less than a year to the city they reside would not be eligible for mortgage loans. It also granted municipalities the authority to control the number of houses or apartments residents and nonresidents can buy. Temporarily relaxed in 2014, HPRP now remains in action in 60 cities. Interested in how such a policy disturb the housing market and reshape household behavior, I propose to construct an inverse demand system of housing and other goods, and apply a PSM-DiD method to evaluate the impacts of HPRP on household consumption, specifically the consumption of education and entertainment. Two sources of data are used: one is household survey data from China Family Panel Studies (CFPS), and the other is a database collected and organized by me and a small team of students from Renmin University of China. This database covers 70 cities, dates from 2001 to 2017 and includes a wide range of city-level economic and housing market attributes. This will be the first project of a paper series which delineates the welfare effects of untraditional demand-side policy (those "regulating" the quantity rather than the price).</div>

## [**From Trash to Treasure: How Effective Sorting Helps China Utilize Food Waste**](https://www.newsecuritybeat.org/2017/08/trash-treasure-effective-sorting-helps-china-utilize-food-waste/)
Liu, L. 2017. New Security Beat, Wilson Center, Washington D.C.

<div style="text-align: justify">
In college, I initiated a research on waste sorting in 5 cities in China. I evaluated the waste sorting policies and their implementation in these cities. In 2017, invited by Dr. Jennifer Turner from Wilson Center, I extended the scope of the research and concentrated on the handling of food waste in China. I then composed this blogpost for the Environmental Change and Security Program of Wilson Center.

This is a blogpost I wrote for "So what", the blog of Aspen Planning and Evaluation Program of the Aspen Institute. I wrote about factors that impacts retrospective voting. I incorporated what I have learned from the course Analytical Politics at Harris.

## [**Good Food Purchasing Program in LA: Impacts and Implications**](https://lizhong-liu.github.io/GFPP_DiD/)

<div style="text-align: justify">Good Food Purchasing Program (GFPP) is an initiative first implemented by Los Angeles in 2012. Public schools are the main bodies adopting this policy. The main idea is to procure meals from local food business and apply harsher standards of nutrition, raw material sources and environmental influences. GFPP has five value criteria: animal welfare, nutrition, support for local business, rights of employees (such as safety and justice), and environmental sustainability. This project aims to identify the effects of this program on local socioeconomic development. As GFPP has been marked as a priority in several other cities, including Austin, Chicago, Cincinnati, Oakland and Twin Cities, and there lack quantitative evaluation of the program, our project can serve as a reference for these other cities in the potential outcomes of GFPP.
<br></br>
Specifically, we employed data on public schools from California Department of Education. We treat public schools in LA county as "the treated", and use the others as the control group. Then using Difference-in-Difference analysis, we attempt to find the causal relations between the implementation of GFPP and the health outcomes of public school students. Based on the regression results, we conclude that It has not been demonstrated obvious benefits on students' physical fitness resulting from the GFPP yet. However, it does not necessarily mean that GFPP does not have any impacts on students' health. As a matter of fact, nutrition-related policies usually have more significant influences on the health outcomes of younger children and children from poorer families. In fact, given that Los Angeles is well-developed and has been implementing GFPP only for 4 years, our results are not especially surprising. Unfortunately, due to the limited data and time we have, we fail to conduct more rigorous quantitative analysis and refine our project.</div>
