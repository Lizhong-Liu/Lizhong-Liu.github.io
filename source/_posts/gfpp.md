_This is a class project for the course, Introduction to Programming for Public Policy._

Good Food Purchasing Program (GFPP) is an initiative first implemented by Los Angeles in 2012. Public schools are the main bodies adopting this policy. The main idea is to procure meals from local food business and apply harsher standards of nutrition, raw material sources and environmental influences. GFPP has five value criteria: animal welfare, nutrition, support for local business, rights of employees (such as safety and justice), and environmental sustainability. This project aims to identify the effects of this program on local socioeconomic development. As GFPP has been marked as a priority in several other cities, including Austin, Chicago, Cincinnati, Oakland and Twin Cities, and there lack quantitative evaluation of the program, our project can serve as a reference for these other cities in the potential outcomes of GFPP.

Specifically, we employed data on public schools from California Department of Education. We treat public schools in LA county as "the treated", and use the others as the control group. Then using Difference-in-Difference analysis, we attempt to find the causal relations between the implementation of GFPP and the health outcomes of public school students. Based on the regression results, we conclude that It has not been demonstrated obvious benefits on students' physical fitness resulting from the GFPP yet. However, it does not necessarily mean that GFPP does not have any impacts on students' health. As a matter of fact, nutrition-related policies usually have more significant influences on the health outcomes of younger children and children from poorer families. In fact, given that Los Angeles is well-developed and has been implementing GFPP only for 4 years, our results are not especially surprising. Unfortunately, due to the limited data and time we have, we fail to conduct more rigorous quantitative analysis and refine our project.
