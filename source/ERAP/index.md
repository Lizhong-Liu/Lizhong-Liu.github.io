##Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic has severely damaged tenant’s ability to pay rents, which also hurts the financial health of landlords. The large-scale eviction moratorium amid the pandemic might further dampen rental market demands and intensify the tenant-landlord relationship. In response to the risk of increasing housing precarity, governments have issued a series of emergency rental assistance programs. Despite their wide availability, little is known about the effectiveness and broader impacts. This research seeks to provide one of the first pieces of evidence on the programs’ effects on the local rental and housing market by studying the Riverside County Emergency Rental Assistance Program. Using a spatial regression discontinuity design, I find suggestive evidence that the Riverside program might help reduce vacancies in rental market and increase landlords’ asking rents. Some suggestive evidence also shows that the program might be effective in preventing landlords from exiting the rental housing market.
