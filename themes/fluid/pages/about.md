Hi, my name is Lizhong Liu. I am currently a PhD student of Public Policy and Management of Sol Price School of Public Policy, University of Southern California. My research focuses on urban economics, housing policy, and especially topics germane to housing affordability and housing stability.

Before pursuing my academic interests, I worked as a macroeconomic analyst. Besides my job, my passions also concentrate on development, especially poverty and inequality. I have been involved in several research projects on inequality issues and policy evaluation. Detailed information on these projects can be found in the [Research page](https://lizhong-liu.github.io/Research/). Right now, I am actively working on two research projects: one is about inequality of opportunity and social stability in China, the other is about the Housing-Purchase Restriction Policy (or ["Xiangou"](http://wiki.china.org.cn/wiki/index.php/Purchase_restriction_order)) and its impacts on household consumption.

I interned for several organizations, including the Aspen Institute at Washington D.C., Ministry of Commerce of P.R.C. and Save the Children at Beijing. I hold a BA in public administration from Renmin University of China and an MPP from Harris School of Public Policy of the University of Chicago.
