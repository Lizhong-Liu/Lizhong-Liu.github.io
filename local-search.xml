I am still on the search for instrumental variables. I believe it could be an interesting thesis for my PhD studies.</div><h3 id="1-Introduction"><a href="#1-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="1 Introduction"></a>1 Introduction</h3><div style="text-align: justify">The mid 1990s witnessed a drastic and long-lasting boom in China’s real estate sector.  The hike in housing prices was primarily realized through the following two channels: first, incentivized by enormous fiscal revenue from selling lands to real estate developers, local governments forcefully introduced a series of policies that accelerate the development of housing markets; second, after abandoning the welfare housing system, city residents’ demands on housing hikes. Plus, with the advancements in marketization, the wealth effect of lands and housing also makes them considerably appealing to investors. As a result, housing prices have been skyrocketing: real growth in house prices averages 10% per annum since 2006 (Gyourko et al, 2016).<br></br>While the real estate sector remains a key component of the Chinese economy, the soaring housing prices engender concerns related to the stability of China’s financial system and macro fundamentals, as well as to the welfare of individual household. The authorities have certainly recognized these issues. Since 2005, a series of policies were enacted to regulate the housing market. First introduced in 2010, Housing Purchase Restriction Policy (HPRP) remains one of the most powerful policy tools to curb the soaring housing prices. According to the “NO. 10 National Notice” (2010) issued by the State Council, non-residents (people without registered permanent residency, or “Hukou” ) who paid taxes or social security for less than a year to the city they reside would not be eligible for mortgage loans. It also granted municipalities the authority to control the number of houses or apartments residents and nonresidents can buy. Temporarily relaxed in 2014, HPRP now remains in action in 60 cities.<br></br>There have been plenty of measures and studies on the regulation the housing markets, but most of them target at the supply side. Gyourko and Molloy (2015) has done an impressive work reviewing research on housing supply regulations (outside China), and concluded that based on available evidence, most studies found negative net welfare effects from regulations. Measures that restrict housing demands, however, are rare. In this sense, HPRP is valuable as it serves as a unique social experiment complementing the studies on market regulations. Just like other types of government interventions, HPRP has great implications on social welfare. There exists abundant literature on HPRP and its effects. Most, if not all, focus on its interactions with housing markets. A bulk of research examine the interdependency between HPRP and housing prices (Zhang, 2016). Some research focuses on how HPRP influences housing markets and how these impacts may differ (Du, 2015; Fang, 2018; Cao and Huang, 2015; Cao, 2017; Lu, 2018; Tzur-Ilan, 2016; Fang, 2018; Chen, 2018; Wu, 2016; Wu and Li, 2017). There do exist some attempts evaluating the welfare effects of HPRP, but mostly by building theoretical frameworks (Li, 2011; Hu 2011; Feng and He, 2012). In addition, it is also useful to evaluate the variations in welfare consequences across different groups (Gyourko, 2015). Thus, I am interested in how HPRP reshape the welfare of individual households, especially how the effects might differ across families with distinct characteristics.<br></br>In this study, I intend to measure the net effects of HPRP on household consumption which is a commonly used proxy for welfare (Garner et al, 2003). HPRP is meant to increase the affordability of housings by stifling speculative demands. When housing purchases are restricted, money that is originally spent on housing will then be diverted into either the consumption of other goods or reinvestments on other assets (Mao, 2011). On the other hand, housing also serves as a capital good whose value grows with price. As evaluated by Wu et al (2012), the expected capital gain from housing is quite high in China. As a result, under HPRP, families can no longer invest in the housing market and thus lose one avenue for investing. Decreases in future returns might discourage household consumption. In addition, whether families regard housings as necessities or means of investments should be primarily determined by household characteristics such as financial conditions and preferences. Thus, depending on individual characteristics, influences of HPRP on households vary. There exist several channels via which HPRP introduced differential impacts (Feng and He, 2012). Families owning one or more houses can be driven away from housing to other consumption markets by HPRP. Alternatively, families that have not owned housings and are not eligible for purchase might increase savings. As these forces are in opposite directions, I am curious about the net effects of HPRP on households’ consumption and how these effects vary across groups. Whilst research on the dynamics of housings prices and consumption is plentiful, few are conducted in the context of HPRP (Dong et al, 2017). Moreover, existing researches at best touched on the effects of HPRP from a macro perspective (Zhang, 2016; Du et al, 2015; Lu, 2018). Few analyzes HPRP from a micro level (Mo, 2015). Although there have already been some works on the correlations between HPRP and consumption, they either focus solely on housing markets or use macro-level data (Mo, 2015; Feng and He, 2012). With access to micro-level data on household finance and demographic features, this paper will try to find empirical evidence on how HPRP influences the welfare of individual family.<br></br>Given the dramatic variations in specific terms of HPRP adopted by municipalities, our study focuses on one specific regulation used by nearly all cities – the number of houses a family can purchase given their “Hukou” and housing ownership status, and control for other bundled policies. I also care most about how HPRP influences households’ consumption on goods other than housing, particularly on education and entertainment. Inverse demand system will be used given the fact that HPRP is constraining the quantity of demand, which makes it more appropriate to take quantity as exogenous when analyzing the markets. To compare how the effects of HPRP might differ regarding individual attributes, I will first identify households living in cities that have enforced HPRP, then utilize Propensity Score Matching (PSM) to construct a control group from households (in other regions) not subject to HPRP but with similar characteristics. Several features characterize HPRP as a quasi-experiment: first, cities have some latitude in determining whether to adopt HPRP or not; second, some cities implemented HPRP while others did not; third, eligibility under HPRP can be argued to be exogenous – “Hukou” and number of houses owned were generally determined prior to the HPRP. In order to measure and compare how the results might differ across different types of households, I divide households into three groups based on the attributes of their demands. We are then able to measure the causal relations between HPRP and the consumption of different types of households via a Difference-in-Difference approach (DiD).</div><h3 id="2-Theoretical-framework-and-hypothesis"><a href="#2-Theoretical-framework-and-hypothesis" class="headerlink" title="2 Theoretical framework and hypothesis"></a>2 Theoretical framework and hypothesis</h3><h4 id="2-1-The-loss-of-welfare-induced-by-HPRP"><a href="#2-1-The-loss-of-welfare-induced-by-HPRP" class="headerlink" title="2.1 The loss of welfare induced by HPRP"></a>2.1 The loss of welfare induced by HPRP</h4><div style="text-align: justify">In light of the studies on Harberger Triangle of welfare and the supply and demand model (Glaeser 2003; Hu, 2011; Feng and He, 2012; Canning and Vroomen, 2019), HPRP and its interaction with the housing market can be presented as the following graph.</div><p><img src="/img/g1.png" alt="graph 1"></p><div style="text-align: justify">HPRP restricts housing purchase by a set of regulatory criteria, including “Hukou”, the number of housings owned by households and the amount of down payment. This design is equivalent to dividing up consumer population into groups based on their eligibility. New demands in housing markets are subsamples from each group (Hu, 2011). Thus, the demand curve would shift inward under HPRP (\(D’\) in Graph 1). Notice that for individual households in the same group, their eligibility of housing purchase is the same. I then assume that the “sampling process” within each group is somewhat random. Further notice that I cannot determine the allocation among different groups and its correlations with group characteristics without empirical evidence. That is, I do not make any specific assumptions about the intercept and the slope of \(D’\). In Graph 1, I let \(D’\) have a smaller elasticity compared to \(D\), but it can be just the opposite in reality.<br></br>Technically, HPRP is very likely to induce welfare loss. The welfare loss generated by HPRP is then determined by the slope and intercept of this new curve (Graph 1). Note that \(D’\) represents the new demand curve under HPRP. The deadweight loss (DWL) from HPRP is the polygon BOCF. This DWL is assumed to be greater than a quantity control scenario (denoted by the vertical line AC) by the area of BACF.</div><h4 id="2-2-Inverse-demand-system-of-housing-and-other-goods"><a href="#2-2-Inverse-demand-system-of-housing-and-other-goods" class="headerlink" title="2.2 Inverse demand system of housing and other goods"></a>2.2 Inverse demand system of housing and other goods</h4><div style="text-align: justify">The main idea of this paper is to evaluate the effects of HPRP on household consumption. Specifically, I am interested in what category of consumption will be impacted by HPRP. There are four “outcome” variables of interest: household expenses on education, household expenses on entertainment, household expenses on housing , and total household expenses. Theoretically, HPRP distorts the equilibrium of housing market, shifting the market demand as it puts a cap on the quantity of houses consumers can purchase. With predetermined budget constraints, households will then alter expenses on other goods. It is worth noting that since HPRP targets on the quantity of demand rather than the market prices, individual household takes the quantity (\(Q\)) as given with prices as a function of quantity (\(P(Q)\)). Therefore, I propose to apply inverse demand system in this paper. The inverse demand in housing market can be expressed as:</div><div style="text-align: center"> \(P_D^h=a_D^h-b_D^h Q_D^h+r_D^h X_D^h+ϵ_D^h\) (1)</div><div style="text-align: justify">Where \(P_D^h\) is housing price, \(Q_D^h\) is the quantity, and \(X_D^h\) is a vector of factors that correlated to market prices (i.e. market shifters). In parallel, the inverse supply is:</div><div style="text-align: center"> \(P_S^h=a_S^h+b_S^h Q_S^h+r_S^h X_S^h+ϵ_S^h\) (2)</div><div style="text-align: justify">The equilibrium in housing market can then be calculated by solving for \(P_D = P_S\), which is:</div><div style="text-align: center"> \(Q_h=(a_D^h-a_S^h+r_D^h X_D^h-r_S^h X_S^h+ϵ_D^h-ϵ_S^h)/(b_D^h+b_S^h )\) (3)\(P_h=(b_S^h a_D^h+b_D^h a_S^h+b_S^h r_D^h X_D^h+b_D^h r_S^h X_S^h+b_D^h ϵ_S^h+b_S^h ϵ_D^h)/(b_D^h+b_S^h )\) (4)</div><div style="text-align: justify">Since we assume that demand of education  is under the influence of housing market distortion, the market demand and supply in education market will then be:</div><div style="text-align: center">\(P_D^e=a_D^e-b_D^e Q_D^e-b_D^h Q_D^h+r_D^e X_D^e+ϵ_D^e\) (5)</div><div style="text-align: center">\(P_S^e=a_S^e+b_S^e Q_S^e+r_S^e X_S^e+ϵ_S^e\) (6)</div>Solving for the education market equilibrium gives us the following function:<div style="text-align: center">\(Q_e=A+B_1 X_D^h+B_2 X_S^h+B_3 X_D^e+B_4 X_S^e+ϵ\) (7)</div><div style="text-align: center">\(P_e=Ζ+γ_1 X_D^h+γ_2 X_S^h+γ_3 X_D^e+γ_4 X_S^e+ϵ\) (8)</div><div style="text-align: justify">where \(Q_e\) is the demand of education (or other goods); \(P_e\) is the price of education; \(X_D^h\) is a vector of factors that influence demand of housing; \(X_S^h\) is a vector of factors that influence supply of housing; \(X_D^e\) is a vector of factors that influence demand of education (or other goods); and \(X_S^e\) is a vector of factors that influence supply of education (or other goods). Coefficients \(A, B, Z\) and \(γ\) can be expressed as functions of \(a_D^e,b_D^e,b_D^h,r_D^e\) and etc. Since \(P_e\) and \(Q_e\) are endogenous and correlated to housing market shifters \(X_D^h\) and \(X_S^h\), HPRP and its effects are also endogenous in education markets. Thus, it is not possible to evaluate the causal effects of HPRP on education (or other goods) market with simple linear model.<br></br>Another challenge we are confronting is the selection bias problem. This is resulted from the nature of HPRP: though it was initiated by the central government of P. R. China, municipalities still enjoyed discretions of whether and when to implement it. As a result, cities chose to adopt HPRP (adopter) can be fundamentally different from cities chose not to (non-adopter). For example, adopters are usually more developed and have higher housing prices than non-adopters. Families living in these two types of cities are also different from each other. Such differences can be correlated to their decisions on consumption and thus bias our estimations.<br></br>To address these two issues, I propose to use Propensity Score Matching (PSM) and Difference-in-Difference (DID) methods. PSM allows me to construct comparable “treatment” and “control” group based on household-level attributes, which addresses the selection bias issue and lay the ground for DID analysis. DID can then cross out the endogenous factors influencing the market demand as long as these factors have similar trend. For the PSM-DID estimation to be valid, several assumptions should be met:</div><ul><li>The trend of the treatment and control group is parallel.</li><li>The allocation of HPRP does not depend on outcomes of interest.</li><li>No spillover effects of HPRP on control group.</li></ul><div style="text-align: justify">Available data only cover one year before HPRP and two years after. Thus, I argue that the “parallel trend” assumption would hold in such a short timeframe. Moreover, since the outcome variables are essentially the consumption on education and entertainment, and since the municipalities chose to adopt HPRP primarily based on market indicators such as housing prices and cities’ administrative level (capitals of provinces are the first to implement HPRP), it is safe to assume that the allocation of HPRP is not based on household consumption. I further assume that HPRP imposes a parallel shift  to the education demand curve (namely, the intercept \(a_D^e\) is now \(a_D^e+μ\)). Therefore, the education demand of the control and treatment group before and after HPRP would be:</div><div style="text-align: center">\(Q_{D,t_0}^C=A_{t_0}+B_1 X_{D,t_0}^h+B_2 X_{S,t_0}^h+B_3 X_{D,t_0}^e+B_4 X_{S,t_0}^e+ϵ_{t_0}\) (9)</div><div style="text-align: center">\(Q_{D,t_0}^T=C_{t_0}+B_1 X_{D,t_0}^h+B_2 X_{S,t_0}^h+B_3 X_{D,t_0}^e+B_4 X_{S,t_0}^e+ϵ_{t_0}\) (10)</div><div style="text-align: center">\(Q_{D,t_1}^C=A_{t_1}+B_1 X_{D,t_1}^h+B_2 X_{S,t_1}^h+B_3 X_{D,t_1}^e+B_4 X_{S,t_1}^e+ϵ_{t_1}\) (11)</div><div style="text-align: center">\(Q_{D,t_1}^T=C_{t_1}+B_1 X_{D,t_1}^h+B_2 X_{S,t_1}^h+B_3 X_{D,t_1}^e+B_4 X_{S,t_1}^e+ϵ_{t_1}\) (12)</div><div style="text-align: justify">Under the assumptions above, we have \(A_{t_0 }=A_{t_1 }=A(b_D^h,b_D^e,b_S^h,b_S^e)\), while \(C_{t_0 }=C(b_D^h,b_D^e,b_S^h,b_S^e)\) and \(C_{t_1}=C(b_D^h,b_D^e,b_S^h,b_S^e,μ)\). I am also assuming that the changes in \(X_D^h,X_S^h,X_D^e,X_S^e\) (observables) and \(ϵ_{t_1}\) (unobservables) across time are the same between the treatment and control group, so they will get crossed out when we do DID analysis. By adding \(X_D^h,X_S^h,X_D^e,X_S^e\) in the DID regression, we can soften the parallel assumption on the observables. However, the unobservables might still bias the estimations if they do not have parallel trend. Thus, it is critical to include the “correct” controls and to interpret the unobservables as having similar trend. As a result, the DID estimator is essentially:</div><div style="text-align: center">\(DID=(Q_{D,t_1}^T-Q_{D,t_0}^T )-(Q_{D,t_1}^C-Q_{D,t_0}^C)=C_{t_1 }-C_{t_0 }=C(b_D^h,b_D^e,b_S^h,b_S^e,μ)\) (13)</div><div style="text-align: justify">This measure partly serves my intention of doing causal inference on HPRP and household consumption. However, what we are really interested in should be the size of \(μ\). A possible solution is to use instrumental variables for HPRP. I am currently on the search for instruments, and the following two occur to me as plausible options: the supply of land and geographical measures such as terrains or elevations.</div><h3 id="3-Descriptive-Statistics-and-PSM"><a href="#3-Descriptive-Statistics-and-PSM" class="headerlink" title="3 Descriptive Statistics and PSM"></a>3 Descriptive Statistics and PSM</h3><div style="text-align: justify">The data I use for this research come from two sources: the first one is China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) offered by Peking University and the second one is a city-level dataset collected by me and a small group of students from Renmin University of China. CFPS is a survey carried out every two years. Thus, it is important to determine whether the data was collected before or after the introduction of HPRP. As shown in the following timetable (Table 1), it is safe to interpret data of 2010 as “before” the implementation of HPRP and 2012 – 2014 as “after”.  Then two steps are taken to perform PSM:Step 1: probit model is used to estimate the probability (or the “propensity score”) of each household to be “adopters” of HPRP.<div style="text-align: center">\(p_i=Prob[HPRP=1|X]\) (14)</div>Here \(p_i\) is the probability/propensity of family \(i\), and \(X\) denotes a vector of controls representing family attributes.Step 2: I then use Kernel-based Matching (KBM) method to match each family in treatment group to several families (with different weights) in control groups. The radius of matching is 0.025.</div><p><img src="/img/table1.png" alt="table1"></p><div style="text-align: justify">With matched treatment and control groups, I then perform DID analysis and estimate the average treatment effects on the treated (ATT). Besides this PSM-DID approach, I also use the fixed effect model to estimate the impacts of HPRP as a robustness check.<br></br>For PSM-DID model, I drop observations from Beijing to ensure that we have a neat sample containing information from both “before” and “after” HPRP. This gives me a sample size of 8921 from 124 cities, half of which have adopted HPRP. Families are matched using data of 2010 so that the effects of HPRP would not distort the matching. The treatment is HPRP, and families ever living in cities adopting HPRP are allocated in the treatment group. Other families are then automatically grouped in the control group. Prior to matching, t-test is run to determined if the treatment and control group have significantly different attributes (including hukou status, household head age, family size and number of housing owned by the family etc.). Results are presented in Table 2. In short, families in the treatment and control group are different, so without any adjustment, a direct estimation using these data will be subject to selection bias.</div><p><img src="/img/table2.png" alt="table2"></p><div style="text-align: justify">I then perform PSM based on the family level controls. KBM is used to match families in treatment group with families in control group. With KBM, every “untreated” observation will be assigned different weights and used to construct the control group, which allow for the inclusion of more information in later regression. Table 3 presents the balance test results after matching. All attributes are balanced, so the matching is successful.</div><p><img src="/img/table3.png" alt="table3"></p><h3 id="Reference"><a href="#Reference" class="headerlink" title="Reference"></a>Reference</h3><div style="text-align: justify">Breslaw, J. and Smith, B.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>This is a class project for the course, Introduction to Programming for Public Policy.</em></p><p>Good Food Purchasing Program (GFPP) is an initiative first implemented by Los Angeles in 2012. Public schools are the main bodies adopting this policy. The main idea is to procure meals from local food business and apply harsher standards of nutrition, raw material sources and environmental influences. GFPP has five value criteria: animal welfare, nutrition, support for local business, rights of employees (such as safety and justice), and environmental sustainability. This project aims to identify the effects of this program on local socioeconomic development. As GFPP has been marked as a priority in several other cities, including Austin, Chicago, Cincinnati, Oakland and Twin Cities, and there lack quantitative evaluation of the program, our project can serve as a reference for these other cities in the potential outcomes of GFPP.</p><p>Specifically, we employed data on public schools from California Department of Education. We treat public schools in LA county as “the treated”, and use the others as the control group. Then using Difference-in-Difference analysis, we attempt to find the causal relations between the implementation of GFPP and the health outcomes of public school students. Based on the regression results, we conclude that It has not been demonstrated obvious benefits on students’ physical fitness resulting from the GFPP yet. However, it does not necessarily mean that GFPP does not have any impacts on students’ health. As a matter of fact, nutrition-related policies usually have more significant influences on the health outcomes of younger children and children from poorer families. In fact, given that Los Angeles is well-developed and has been implementing GFPP only for 4 years, our results are not especially surprising. Unfortunately, due to the limited data and time we have, we fail to conduct more rigorous quantitative analysis and refine our project.</p><p><strong>Please refer to this <a href="https://lizhong-liu.github.io/GFPP_DiD/">link</a> for the website for the project, and this <a href="https://github.com/Lizhong-Liu/GFPP_DiD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a> to the Github site.</strong></p>]]></content>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>In college, I initiated a research on waste sorting in 5 cities in China. I evaluated the waste sorting policies and their implementation in these cities. In 2017, invited by Dr. Jennifer Turner from Wilson Center, I extended the scope of the research and concentrated on the handling of food waste in China. I then composed this blogpost for the Environmental Change and Security Program of Wilson Center.</em></p><p><strong>Please follow this <a href="https://www.newsecuritybeat.org/2017/08/trash-treasure-effective-sorting-helps-china-utilize-food-waste/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a> for the original post.</strong></p><p>Launched in Beijing in 2013, the highly successful grassroots <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-china-21711928" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“Empty Your Plate”</a> campaign encourages Chinese consumers to eliminate food waste from their meals. Starting with <a href="http://focus.weibo.com/pub/i/zt/weibozhanshi" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog posts</a> on Weibo (China’s equivalent of Twitter), this campaign rapidly swept the entire country and attracted support from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/28/world/asia/xi-jinping-imposes-austerity-measures-on-chinas-elite.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the</a> central government, which later issued <a href="https://www.chinainternetwatch.com/9769/forbid-catering-operators-to-set-minimum-consumption/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a series of policies</a> urging restaurants to use smaller dishes and remove minimum charges. However, the volume of food waste in China is still astonishing.</p><p>From 2013 to 2015, China generated <a href="http://www.china.org.cn/china/2016-12/09/content_39882640.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">17-18 million</a> tons of food waste each year—enough to feed 30-50 million people. This not only wastes natural resources including fresh water, arable land, and energy, but also severely impacts the urban environment. When improperly disposed, food waste can pollute water, degrade the soil, and increase emissions of greenhouse gases. But with effective sorting and repurposing, food waste can become a valuable resource that can be used to produce biofuels, chemicals, animal feed, and compost.</p><h3 id="Sorting-A-Gateway-to-Reutilizing-Food-Waste"><a href="#Sorting-A-Gateway-to-Reutilizing-Food-Waste" class="headerlink" title="Sorting: A Gateway to Reutilizing Food Waste"></a>Sorting: A Gateway to Reutilizing Food Waste</h3><p>Like many other countries in the world, reusing food waste is not yet common practice in China. When kitchens and restaurants throw away their scraps, food waste is mixed with other city garbage, compressed at processing facilities, and then transported to landfills or incinerators via transfer stations. Food scraps usually comprise <a href="http://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/agriculture-and-food/food-losses-and-food-waste-in-china_5jz5sq5173lq-en;jsessionid=4pcrr65cmof5l.x-oecd-live-02" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50 to 70 percent</a> of China’s municipal solid waste, a much higher percentage than that of the United States (<a href="https://archive.epa.gov/epawaste/nonhaz/municipal/web/html/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">28 percent</a>). Several Chinese cities such as <a href="http://www.eco-business.com/news/one-companys-mission-to-turn-chinas-waste-into-energy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Changsha and Zhenjiang</a> have built anaerobic digestion or co-digestion facilities in local sludge treatment plants to produce biogas and fertilizer from waste. However, those plants tend to operate at a loss when feedstock like food scraps is not collected separately at the source. The earlier food waste is separated from other waste streams, the easier it is to use it to produce biogas through anaerobic digestion or <a href="https://www.newsecuritybeat.org/2016/05/innovative-sludge-to-energy-plant-breakthrough-china/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sludge-to-energy methods</a>.</p><p>The Chinese government has been advocating for sorting waste in cities for almost 20 years, albeit with little progress. In <a href="https://www.chinadialogue.net/article/show/single/en/9812-China-is-sorting-its-household-waste-problem" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2000</a> the Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development (MOHURD) designated eight cities (including Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Shenzhen) as pilots, forcing the municipalities to implement innovative policies to resolve urban garbage problems. In 2007, MOHURD issued a national regulation to streamline <a href="http://www.mohurd.gov.cn/fgjs/jsbgz/200706/t20070604_159100.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the disposal chain</a> for solid waste, which encouraged individuals and public institutions to separate scraps before dumping them into trash bins. In response, municipal governments have also carried out waste sorting measures in residential areas and public buildings, hoping to resolve the triple threat of shrinking landfill space in urban outskirts, increasing costs of solid waste management, and growing public concerns over waste pollution.</p><h3 id="Why-Is-Sorting-Waste-So-Difficult-in-China"><a href="#Why-Is-Sorting-Waste-So-Difficult-in-China" class="headerlink" title="Why Is Sorting Waste So Difficult in China?"></a>Why Is Sorting Waste So Difficult in China?</h3><p>Though disposal chain regulations have remained in effect for the past 10 years, most Chinese cities still struggle to manage the waste sorting and food waste disposal process. Public awareness and engagement has long been a barrier to classifying and packaging urban waste. Cities along China’s east coast usually have more efficient sorting systems and a higher waste reutilization than their inland counterparts due to strong policies and investment plans for both infrastructure and awareness-building, as well as public oversight by communities and nongovernmental organizations.</p><p>However, in underdeveloped cities, existing noncompulsory regulations have proven less effective at inducing behavioral changes and promoting public participation. In 2014, I surveyed citizens in six cities about their understanding of municipal waste. In Jingzhou—a small river port city of just under one million people located on the banks of the Yangtze River in Hubei Province—eight out of ten interviewees were unaware of the importance of waste classification. “I seldom think of sorting the garbage before dumping it and I don’t think it matters because no one really cares about it,” said one.</p><p>Even after households and restaurants voluntarily separate food waste from recyclables and non-recyclables, there is still a good chance that scraps will mix somewhere else in the process. China’s municipal garbage sorting largely relies on <a href="http://www.coresponsibility.com/report/informal-waste/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scavengers</a> and workers at sanitation stations. As the market value of food scraps is much lower than recyclables like paper and plastic, both the formal and informal sectors are reluctant to thoroughly sort food waste without financial incentives. In <a href="http://www.sixthtone.com/news/1000294/chinas-latest-trash-sorting-push-not-good-enough%2C-experts-say" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shenzhen</a>, a pilot city for 17 years, 90 percent of local residents are well informed about the waste classification scheme, yet less than 20 percent effectively sort their household waste under the city’s scattered solid waste distribution system.</p><h3 id="Mandatory-Garbage-Sorting-A-New-Hope-for-Food-Waste"><a href="#Mandatory-Garbage-Sorting-A-New-Hope-for-Food-Waste" class="headerlink" title="Mandatory Garbage Sorting: A New Hope for Food Waste?"></a>Mandatory Garbage Sorting: A New Hope for Food Waste?</h3><p>In March 2017, National Development and Reform Commission and MOHURD selected <a href="https://news.cgtn.com/news/3d67544e7a637a4d/share_p.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">46 cities</a> for mandatory garbage sorting, with the goal of achieving a minimal recycling rate of 35 percent by 2020. According to its <a href="http://hzs.ndrc.gov.cn/newzwxx/201703/W020170331321268083586.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">classification standards</a>, the “wet” garbage (food waste) must be separated from the “dry” garbage (other types of waste) in order to reach the recycling threshold. All public institutions, supermarkets, hotels, restaurants, and office buildings are required to follow the rules or face a penalty. Echoing the plan, Chinese municipalities are increasing investments in public education and boosting public-private partnerships for constructing waste infrastructure. For instance, the Beijing city government has built <a href="http://www.shanghaidaily.com/opinion/chinese-perspectives/Beijing-grapples-with-growing-kitchen-waste/shdaily.shtml" target="_blank" rel="noopener">five</a> new waste processing centers and employed more than <a href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/cndy/2017-04/13/content_28903270.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20,000</a> inspectors to improve waste sorting practices. One district government offers to <a href="http://epaper.ynet.com/html/2017-06/05/content_251463.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">pay</a> residents 1700 RMB ($250) for each ton of classified household garbage, in either a monthly lump sum to property managers who then opt to incentivize high-performing households, or a direct award of 0.5 RMB for each disposal.  </p><p>Mandatory waste sorting rules have forced municipal governments in the 46 pilot cities to introduce innovative policies and initiatives to resolve their urban garbage problems. If these rules help change public awareness and habits, introduce clean technology, and use food scraps in sustainable or productive ways, it could pave the way for other cities and villages in China to follow.</p><p><em>Sources: BBC, Beijing Youth Daily, CGTN, China Daily, China Dialogue, China Internet Watch, China.org.cn, Collective Responsibility, Eco-Business, Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development of P.
